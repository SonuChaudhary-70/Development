        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Corbett_National_Park">Jim Corbett National Park is a
            national park in India located in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand state. The first national park in
            India, it was established in 1936 during the British Raj and named Hailey National Park after William
            Malcolm Hailey, a governor of the United Provinces in which it was then located. In 1956, nearly a decade
            after India's independence, it was renamed Corbett National Park after the hunter and naturalist Jim
            Corbett, who had played a leading role in its establishment and had died the year before. The park was the
            first to come under the Project Tiger initiative.[2]</blockquote>

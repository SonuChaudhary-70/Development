By using querySelectorAll() 

we can change item of html collection by its index number 
If we want apply a specific style to all element of html collection we have use for loop to go through all the elements
Ex - for (let ele of items) {
    ele.style.fontWeight = 'bold'
    ele.style.border = '2px solid black'
}
